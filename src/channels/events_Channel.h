    /**
     * Base abstract class for all channels.  It has the common methods, the
     * process resource listener, and the type of the subclass.  This class
     * and all subclasses are completely thread safe.
     *
     * Channels are a one way data flow composed of a sender and receiver.
     * Items are sent and flow control is done by called methods directly
     * on the Channel class.  Items or state changes can be received either
     * via a callback (any class) or a message (process).  There can be
     * multiple senders, but only one receiver.  By default, no receiver is
     * specified, meaning items disappear upon being sent (like /dev/null).
     *
     * By default the flow control is blocked to allow for proper setup
     * before allowing items through.
     *
     * Both the sender and receiver get callbacks (or messages)
     * when the state changes.
     *
     *
     * Note that there are serious deadlock issues to consider when using this
     * class if the following situations are true:
     *   You get callbacks from this Channel.
     *   You call methods on the Channel.
     *   Your class uses a mutex to lock itself when calling methods on the
     *     Channel.
     * In this situation, you must use the WriteToken to lock the Channel
     * BEFORE locking your own mutex, prior to calling any methods on
     * the Channel.  If this is not done, a deadlock is likely to result
     * at some point.
     *
     *
     * While it is ideal for only one class to keep a pointer to a channel,
     * this is generally impossible.  Therefore, Channels handle pointer
     * ownership as follows:
     *   Channels must only be constructed on the heap (pointers), never as
     *   stack variables.
     *
     *   'delete' should never be directly used on a Channel.
     *
     *   Channel employs basically a reference counting system to know who
     *   holds a pointer to it.  When all references are released, the
     *   Channel will automatically delete itself.
     *
     *   If no one initially registers as a listener or indicates it is
     *   referencing the Channel, it will not delete itself.  This is to
     *   prevent the Channel from deleting itself immediately upon construction.
     *
     *   A Channel is referenced by a class when it registers as a
     *   listener or explicitly indicates it is holding a reference.
     *
     *   Before using the channel (opening, closing, sending messages, locking,
     *   etc), at least one class must explicitly reference the Channel either
     *   via pointers (listener, etc) or as a resource.  If this is not done,
     *   the Channel may auto-delete.
     *
     *   TODO Consider boost shared_ptr in the future, depending on how many need direct Channel access.
     *   TODO The pointer ownership is too complicated and might be reinventing the wheel.
