     * This class is both the Router, and Session Manager due to heavily
     * intertwined data.
     *
     * This class routes data to and from the various implementors of
     * ClientConnection (socket, websocket, etc).  It has code common to
     * all connection types, such as authentication.
     *
     * It also services all connection types on a single thread, however it
     * has to use frequent polling for this.
     * TODO Figure out a more efficient mechanism without frequent polling
     *
     * This class also keeps track of and manages what ClientSession is
     * associated with what Player, and also contains various algorithms related
     * to session management (getting list of who is online, idle disconnects,
     * channel management, etc).  Originally the functionality in this
     * paragraph was going to be in a separate class, but was decided the
     * complexity of dealing with pointers that could disappear at any point
     * was not worth it at this time.  Basically this class would become
     * a proxy/facade for everthing that other class would want.  The two
     * classes would be so closely intertwined that keeping them separate
     * didn't seem to have any benefit at this time.
     *
     * Currently this is single threaded.  In the future, multiple of these
     * could exist, running on different threads, with one set aside for
     * authentication, etc.  Drivers always take in a pointer to this
     * to allow for that possibility in the future.
